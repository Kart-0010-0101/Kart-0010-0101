 Everyone wants to Reach Heaven.
 But, No One is Ready to Die.

 This thought-provoking quote by Robert Kiyosaki reminds us of the paradox of human desires. We all aspire to achieve great heights and reach our version of 'Heaven' in life, whether it's success, happiness, or fulfillment. However, it underscores the reluctance most of us have when it comes to facing the challenges and changes required to attain those goals. It's a reminder that embracing change and taking risks are essential steps on the journey to our own 'Heaven.'
